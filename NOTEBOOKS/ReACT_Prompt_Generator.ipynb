Thought 1: I have been given the article \\\"On the abandonment and survival of open source projects: An empirical investigation.\\\" My task is to identify specific, actionable recommendations within the article that can help make open source software projects more sustainable. These recommendations are usually presented as imperative sentences or phrases that provide clear instructions or suggestions. Action 1: Carefully read through the entire article, focusing on sections discussing factors affecting project sustainability and any recommendations provided by the authors. Highlight or make a list of the actionable recommendations found. Observation 1: A list of actionable recommendations has been compiled from the article. Thought 2: To ensure clarity and ease of understanding, I should refine the list of recommendations, removing any redundant or ambiguous suggestions. Action 2: Review the list of recommendations and make necessary adjustments to ensure they are clear, concise, and easily understandable. Observation 2: The list of recommendations has been refined, and is now clear and concise. Thought 3: Assigning confidence scores to each recommendation will help prioritize them based on their importance and feasibility. The scores should be based on how confident I am about the effectiveness of the recommendation for making open-source projects sustainable. A brief explanation should be provided for each confidence score to justify the assigned value. Action 3: For each recommendation in the final list, assign a confidence level on a scale of 1 to 5, indicating how confident I am in the effectiveness of the recommendation for making open-source projects sustainable. A score of 1 indicates low confidence, while a score of 5 indicates high confidence. Provide a brief explanation for each assigned confidence level. Observation 3: Confidence scores have been assigned to each recommendation in the final list, along with reasonable explanations.

            "Developers at the center of OSS communities should not only focus on the development of the system itself, but also pay enough attention to the creation and maintenance of a dynamic and self-reproducing OSS community. Core Members and Active Developers should also strive to create an environment and culture that fosters the sense of belonging to the community and mechanisms that encourage and enable newcomers to move toward the center of the community through continual contributions. It is very important for the community to be responsive to the questions and contributions of newcomers to sustain their interest and encourage their further participation. Old members should remember that they are also the learning resources for newcomers. One possible mechanism is to have skilled members take turns in the mailing list to answer questions of newcomers, to help new contributors perfect their code contributions. People who want to start an OSS project need to consider how many learning opportunities it offers, and how easy it is for others to participate legitimately and peripherally. For example, a system developed with COBOL is probably less attractive to OSS developers than a system developed with Java because the demands for COBOL developers are much lower in today’s world. A system with large size and cumbersome architecture, such as the early version of Mozilla, is also difficult to attract OSS participants [2].\n",

We applied the LPP theory to understand how to form and sustain OSS communities that are essential to the success of OSS projects. We argued that learning is one of the major driving forces that motivate people to get involved in OSS communities. We discussed how our theory can inform software engineering researchers and OSS practitioners.\n",
